_If you're new to smart contract development, head to [Developing Smart Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/developing-smart-contracts) to learn about creating a new project and compiling your contracts._

To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources, nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use are deployed, so you don't need to worry about it needlessly increasing gas costs.

The guides in the [docs site](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts) will teach about different concepts, and how to use the related contracts that OpenZeppelin Contracts provides:

* [Access Control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/access-control): decide who can perform each of the actions on your system.
* [Tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/tokens): create tradeable assets or collectives, and distribute them via [Crowdsales](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/crowdsales).
* [Gas Station Network](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/gsn): let your users interact with your contracts without having to pay for gas themselves.
* [Utilities](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/utilities): generic useful tools, including non-overflowing math, signature verification, and trustless paying systems.

The [full API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC20) is also thoroughly documented, and serves as a great reference when developing your smart contract application. You can also ask for help or follow Contracts's development in the [community forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com).

**A library for secure smart contract development.** Build on a solid foundation of community-vetted code.

 * Implementations of standards like [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/erc20) and [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/erc721).
 * Flexible [role-based permissioning](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/access-control) scheme.
